Letter of Endorsement for Suma Shamanna
Candidate for Regional Vice Chair AP
     
I am delighted to endorse Suma for Regional Vice Chair Asia Pacific. Suma has provided outstanding leadership and support
for the CCs and Chapters in our region. She has:
    
Greatly enhanced our regional cohesiveness
Facilitated more and better sharing of resources and knowledge 
Provided much needed organizational tools 
Improved communication in our region 
Improved outcomes in our region (cleaner membership databases, increased GOTV resources as just two examples) 
   
Suma’s ability to foster collaboration across country committees has strengthened our collective efforts. She leads
with both clarity and patience - essential qualities across such a large and diverse region. Suma consistently puts
our democratic values into action. One visible measure of her success is greater representation and participation
from the AP region at the Global level. 
      
I fully support Suma and am confident that her continued leadership will serve the AP region and Democrats Abroad
with integrity, effectiveness, and heart.

Sincerely,
Aisling O’Leary
