Letter of Endorsement for Suma Shamanna
Candidate for Regional Vice Chair AP
     
I am delighted to endorse Suma for Regional Vice Chair Asia Pacific. Suma has provided outstanding leadership and support
for the CCs and Chapters in our region. She has:
    
Greatly enhanced our regional cohesiveness
Facilitated more and better sharing of resources and knowledge 
Provided much needed organizational tools 
Improved communication in our region 
Improved outcomes in our region (cleaner membership databases, increased GOTV resources as just two examples) 
   
Suma’s ability to foster collaboration across country committees has strengthened our collective efforts. She leads
with both clarity and patience - essential qualities across such a large and diverse region. Suma consistently puts
our democratic values into action. One visible measure of her success is greater representation and participation
from the AP region at the Global level. 
      
I fully support Suma and am confident that her continued leadership will serve the AP region and Democrats Abroad
with integrity, effectiveness, and heart.

Sincerely,

"I am very proud and pleased to write a letter of endorsement for Suma Shamanna as Asia-Pacific Regional Vice Chair.   
Suma has been exceptional in her leadership in the AP region, especially  in recruiting, encouraging and assisting
DA members to take an active role in our activities in DA.  Suma has been a wonderful manager and organizer in a 
very diverse group throughout  a very large region, and she has been very patient in dealing with our issues and 
personalities.   
    </p>
      <p>
I have been a member of DA since 2007, during the first Obama campaign, and Suma is one of the most supportive 
and nurturing leaders I have worked with in the organization.  She is always instantly available for working 
discussions, succinct  in explaining issues and worked with me patiently thru our social media efforts!
      </p>
<p>Many thanks, Suma, I very wholeheartedly endorse your candidacy as AP RVC."</p>

"Greetings AP Region,
    </p>
    <p>   
My name is Cory Lemke, and I have served as DAROK Country Chair, the International Treasurer and now as 
your Asia Pacific representative to the Democratic National Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
The United States is facing an unprecedented erosion of democratic norms and values at the hands of 
Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress. Our greatest challenge as a region is not the length of our 
meetings. It is engaging the 500,000 Americans in the Asia Pacific region and ensuring that their votes
are counted. We need a leader that understands this and has the experience to see this through.
    </p>
    <p>
That leader, without a doubt, is Suma Shamanna. Suma and I concurrently served as Country Committee
Chairs together. I witnessed how she used relational organizing to build out DA India, not just in her
local Bangalore, but across the country. As Asia Pacific Regional Vice Chair, Suma restored the regional
infrastructure and enabled our region to function effectively and autonomously. As a Global leader, Suma 
has ensured wide AP representation in the organization while also maintaining organizing energy within the
region. I have no doubt that Suma will continue to thrive in the position.
    </p>
    <p>
At every point in my relationship with Suma, I have seen her as a do-er. Now is not the time to take our 
foot off the gas. Vote Suma for AP Regional Vice Chair."
    </p>
In solidarity,

Cory Lemke

     "I hereby wish to recommend Suma Shamanna for an additional term as RVC Asia Pacific.
Suma has led India as Country Vice Chair, and as Country Chair in the past motivating others
to join DA. Suma has vast knowledge of how DA works and her follow up and online interactions
with the respective Country Committees has been beneficial to the Asia Pacific region.
       
She has certainly proved her leadership over the last four years that I have known her as 
so many others have too. I am sure that she would like to continue to take what she has 
started over the last two years forward and continue to increase membership activity and
interaction within the region.
